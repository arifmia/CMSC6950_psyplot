# CMSC6950 - Pymagicc: A Python wrapper for the simple climate model MAGICC

# S M Arifuzzaman

Pymagicc is a Python wrapper around the reduced complexity climate model MAGICC6. It wraps the CC-BY-NC-SA licensed MAGICC6 binary. Pymagicc itself is AGPL licensed.

MAGICC (Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change) is widely used in the assessment of future emissions pathways in climate policy analyses, e.g. in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or to model the physical aspects of climate change in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).
